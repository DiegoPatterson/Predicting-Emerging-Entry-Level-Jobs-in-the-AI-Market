# Predicting-Emerging-Entry-Level-Jobs-in-the-AI-Market

__Problem Statement__
In the current Job market, many students and graduates worry about whether they could 
get a job or not in the field that they studied. Some look at the incoming jobs and just begin to 
lose hope, others spend time searching and getting denied without even knowing where they are 
going wrong. With so many resources on finding jobs yet little resources explaining the skill 
level of each, many are left searching without knowing what they are looking for. This is the 
problem that I look to solve with my research. I would like to train an AI to predict the 
direction of the entry level jobs in the job market, hoping to find out what skills and fields 
you should be focusing on and applying to get a job. Due to needing to predict the forecasted 
job demand over time, this will likely be a regressing problem, given that I wish to predict 
growth. To quantify when I have reached a successful point from my model, I will ensure that the 
regression model achieves at lease a 20% lower forecasting error (MAPE/RMSE) than a simple 
baseline predictor. This will be paired with a ranked list of entry-level AI roles that align with 
current industry insights. Finally, the results will be formatted in a way that will highlight what 
skills and roles are most associated with further growth. 

__Dataset Analysis__
The dataset I have chosen to successfully predict future entry-level jobs and 
qualifications is one from Kaggle, titled 
“AI Job Market Trends” by Abhishek 
Jaiswal (2023). This data set consists of 
over 2,000 synthetic but realistic job 
listings that capture:
- Company information
- Industry domain
- Job titles & experience levels
- Location and employment type
- Posting dates (2023–2025)
