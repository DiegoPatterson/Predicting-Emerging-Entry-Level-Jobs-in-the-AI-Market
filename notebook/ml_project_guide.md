# AI Job Market Prediction: Jupyter Notebook Guide

## Project Overview
This guide organizes your machine learning project into clear Jupyter Notebook sections. Each section explains what to do, why it matters, and what you're trying to accomplish.

---

## Recommended Notebook Structure

Your Jupyter Notebook should flow in this order:

### **Section 1: Setup and Imports** (1 cell)
- Import all necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Set up visualization preferences
- Verify everything imported correctly

**Why:** Getting all imports done upfront prevents interruptions later. You'll know immediately if any libraries are missing.

---

### **Section 2: Load and Explore Data** (3-4 cells)

**Cell 1:** Load your CSV file
- Read the data using pandas
- Print shape and basic info

**Cell 2:** Display first rows and column names
- Use `df.head()` to see what you're working with
- List all column names to understand structure

**Cell 3:** Check for missing values and data types
- Use `df.info()` and `df.isnull().sum()`
- Identify any problems early

**Cell 4:** Explore categorical columns
- Check unique values in Experience_Level, Location, Employment_Type, Industry
- Use `value_counts()` to see distributions

**Why:** You need to understand your data before you can clean or model it. This exploration reveals patterns, problems, and what's actually in your dataset.

---

### **Section 3: Data Cleaning** (3 cells)

**Cell 1:** Handle missing values
- Drop rows with missing data or fill them appropriately
- Track how many rows you removed

**Cell 2:** Filter for entry-level positions
- Use string matching to find entry-level, junior, beginner roles
- Calculate what percentage of jobs are entry-level

**Cell 3:** Convert dates and extract time features
- Parse the Posting_Date column as datetime
- Extract Year, Month, Quarter, DayOfYear

**Why:** Clean data is essential for accurate models. Filtering for entry-level focuses your analysis on the research question. Time features let your model learn temporal patterns.

---

### **Section 4: Feature Engineering** (4 cells)

**Cell 1:** Create your target variable
- Group entry-level jobs by Year and Month
- Count jobs per month (this is what you'll predict)
- Add a Time_Index column (0, 1, 2, 3... for each month)

**Cell 2:** Visualize the job trend over time
- Plot job counts to see if there's growth, seasonality, or patterns
- This helps you understand what you're trying to predict

**Cell 3:** Create lag features
- Add previous months' job counts as features (Lag_1, Lag_2, Lag_3)
- Drop rows with NaN created by shifting

**Cell 4:** Add seasonal features
- Create Month_Sin and Month_Cos using sine/cosine transformations
- These help capture cyclical patterns (like hiring seasons)

**Why:** The target variable is your prediction goal. Lag features give the model memory of recent trends. Seasonal features capture recurring patterns like Q1 hiring surges.

---

### **Section 5: Train/Test Split** (2 cells)

**Cell 1:** Split data chronologically
- Define your feature columns
- Split 80% training (earlier months) and 20% testing (later months)
- Never shuffle - maintain time order!

**Cell 2:** Visualize the split
- Plot training data in one color, test data in another
- Draw a vertical line at the split point

**Why:** Time-based splitting simulates real forecasting - you train on the past and predict the future. Random splitting would leak future information into training, making results unrealistic.

---

### **Section 6: Baseline Model** (2 cells)

**Cell 1:** Create baseline predictions
- Define a MAPE calculation function
- Predict the training data mean for all test months
- This is your "naive" benchmark

**Cell 2:** Evaluate baseline performance
- Calculate RMSE, MAPE, and MAE
- Visualize baseline predictions vs actual values

**Why:** A baseline establishes your minimum acceptable performance. If your complex model can't beat a simple average, something's wrong with your approach.

---

### **Section 7: Random Forest Model** (3 cells)

**Cell 1:** Train Random Forest
- Initialize RandomForestRegressor with parameters
- Fit on training data
- Generate predictions on test data

**Cell 2:** Evaluate Random Forest
- Calculate RMSE, MAPE, MAE
- Compare to baseline and calculate improvement percentage
- Check if you hit the 20% improvement target

**Cell 3:** Visualize predictions
- Plot actual vs Random Forest vs baseline
- Show how much better your model performs

**Why:** Random Forest handles non-linear relationships and mixed features well. It's your primary model because it can capture complex patterns without overfitting like deep learning might.

---

### **Section 8: Linear Regression** (2 cells)

**Cell 1:** Train Linear Regression
- Fit a simple linear model
- Calculate metrics (RMSE, MAPE, MAE)
- Compare improvement to baseline

**Cell 2:** Compare all three models
- Plot all predictions together: actual, baseline, Linear Regression, Random Forest
- See which performs best visually

**Why:** Linear Regression tests if simpler is sufficient. If it performs similarly to Random Forest, you might not need the complexity. This comparison strengthens your justification for model choice.

---

### **Section 9: Model Comparison Summary** (3 cells)

**Cell 1:** Create comparison table
- Build a DataFrame with all metrics for all models
- Display side-by-side for easy comparison
- Identify the best model

**Cell 2:** Visualize metrics with bar charts
- Create bar charts for RMSE, MAPE, and MAE
- Make it easy to see performance differences

**Cell 3:** Residual analysis
- Plot residuals (errors) for Random Forest
- Check if errors are randomly distributed or show patterns
- Histogram of residual distribution

**Why:** Clear comparison validates your model choice. Residual analysis ensures your model isn't systematically biased in its predictions.

---

### **Section 10: Feature Importance** (2 cells)

**Cell 1:** Extract feature importance scores
- Get importance values from Random Forest
- Create a sorted table showing which features matter most

**Cell 2:** Visualize importance
- Create horizontal bar chart of feature importance
- Highlight top predictors

**Why:** Feature importance reveals what drives predictions. High importance for certain features tells you what factors most influence job growth - directly answering your research question.

---

### **Section 11: Entry-Level Job Trends** (4 cells)

**Cell 1:** Identify fastest growing roles
- Group by Job_Title and calculate growth rates
- Rank roles by growth percentage
- Display top 10

**Cell 2:** Visualize top growing roles
- Bar chart of growth rates for top roles
- This shows which positions to target

**Cell 3:** Location analysis
- Count jobs by location
- Visualize top 10 cities/regions
- Shows where opportunities are concentrated

**Cell 4:** Employment type distribution
- Analyze Full-time, Part-time, Remote, Contract, etc.
- Create pie chart showing distribution
- Reveals work arrangement trends

**Cell 5 (optional):** Industry analysis
- If available, show which industries hire most entry-level AI roles
- Compare across sectors

**Why:** These analyses directly answer your research question: what skills/roles to focus on and where to apply. This is the actionable insight for job seekers.

---

### **Section 12: Final Summary and Recommendations** (2 cells)

**Cell 1:** Print comprehensive results summary
- Best model and its performance metrics
- Whether you achieved 20% improvement target
- Key findings about job trends

**Cell 2:** Generate recommendations
- List top 3-5 growing roles to pursue
- Identify best locations
- Suggest employment types to consider
- Provide actionable advice based on data

**Why:** This synthesizes everything into clear, actionable guidance. Your project isn't just about model performance - it's about helping job seekers make informed decisions.

## Key Decisions and Why They Matter

### Why Random Forest over other models?
- Handles mixed data types (categorical and numerical) naturally
- Captures non-linear relationships without needing manual feature engineering
- Provides feature importance scores for interpretation
- Resistant to overfitting with proper parameters
- Doesn't require feature scaling

### Why time-based split instead of random?
- Prevents data leakage (using future to predict past)
- Mimics real-world forecasting scenario
- More honest evaluation of prediction capability

### Why lag features?
- Recent history often predicts near-term future
- Gives model "memory" of trends
- Helps capture momentum in job postings

### Why multiple metrics (RMSE, MAPE, MAE)?
- RMSE: Penalizes large errors heavily, good for outlier detection
- MAPE: Percentage error, easy to interpret and communicate
- MAE: Simple average error, less sensitive to outliers
- Together they give complete performance picture

### Why 20% improvement target?
- Demonstrates meaningful predictive power beyond simple baseline
- Industry-standard threshold for model usefulness
- Makes success criteria measurable and objective

## Common Issues to Watch For

**Problem:** Not enough data after filtering for entry-level
- **Solution:** Broaden your filter criteria or check if column names match exactly

**Problem:** Features have different scales
- **Solution:** Random Forest doesn't need scaling, but Linear Regression might benefit from it

**Problem:** Model performs well on training but poorly on test
- **Solution:** Overfitting - reduce max_depth in Random Forest or add more data

**Problem:** Predictions are constant or barely change
- **Solution:** Features might not be informative - check feature importance and add more relevant features

**Problem:** MAPE gives errors or infinity
- **Solution:** Can't divide by zero - filter out rows where actual value is 0

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Run cells sequentially** - Don't skip around or you'll have undefined variables
2. **Add markdown cells** - Explain what each section does in plain English
3. **Print shape often** - After each transformation, verify your data dimensions
4. **Save your notebook frequently** - Jupyter can crash; don't lose work
5. **Clear outputs and restart kernel** - Before final submission, restart and run all cells to ensure reproducibility
6. **Comment your code** - Explain non-obvious choices for future reference
7. **Use descriptive variable names** - `monthly_counts` is better than `df2`
